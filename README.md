🌮 Felipe's Taqueria Cash Register App 🌮

Introducing my latest project – a feature-rich cash register app for Felipe's Taqueria! 🚀

Key Features:

🖥️ Interactive GUI: Transformed the original CS50 command-line program into a visually appealing interface using Tkinter. Now, users can easily navigate the menu, making their selections with just a click.

📋 Menu Selection: Implemented a dynamic dropdown menu, allowing users to select from a variety of delicious items, each with its own price tag.

💳 Cash-Out System: Streamlined the ordering process by introducing a cash-out button. Users can review their selections, and with a click, generate a detailed receipt showcasing individual items and the total cost.

🔄 Order Reset: Added a reset function for a seamless transition between transactions. The app is ready for the next customer's order with just one click.

🚀 Built on Python: Leveraging the power of Python, Tkinter, and the skills honed during CS50’s Introduction to Programming, this app showcases a blend of functionality and aesthetics.

👨‍💻 Personal Growth: This project allowed me to expand my programming skills beyond the basics, diving into GUI development and creating a practical application for everyday scenarios.

🌟 Excited for More: Eager to explore further and enhance my coding abilities with future projects. Stay tuned for more innovative developments!
